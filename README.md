# Bird-Deterrent-System
YOLOv8 + OpenCV + Arduino Integration
• Developed a real-time bird deterrent system to protect crops using vision-based object detection and mechatronic controls, ensuring non-lethal and eco-friendly deterrence.
• Led the software and ML development, integrating YOLOv8 with OpenCV to detect birds and map their position to servo angles for precise laser alignment.
• Implemented servo control through Arduino using pyfirmata and motor mapping via cvzone (OpenCV + NumPy backend).
• Built a 360° rotating stand with stepper motors and CNC shield for full-range bird tracking and deterrence.
• Tech stack: Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, NumPy, cvzone, pyfirmata, Arduino, CNC Shield, Servo Motors
